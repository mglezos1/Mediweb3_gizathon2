Submission for the Mu gizathon

The idea behind this hackathon submission was to create an application focusing on aiding medical researchers collecting data to conduct studies by preserving the privacy of the patients of the information recieved. This would help removing legal and ethical roadbloacks as well as potentially put patients at ease when it comes to sharing information.

For this project we use the existing dengue outbreak in Buenos Aires to see if there is a corolation with the number of cases the medical employee would input the patient information such as "Name", "Weight" "Height" and the Positive/Negative status of Dengue. The infomation would leave the patient information out and only obtain the positive/negative status with the location of the clinic to gather the total number of Dengue cases in Buenos Aires and in what neighborhoods. This would then be combined with the participation in the city to determine if there is a corolation between the amount of rain and the amount of dengue cases. 

The model was created using a decision tree model on Onnx, before converted to Cairo. The proff was then transpired before being uploaded onto the Starknet Chain.
